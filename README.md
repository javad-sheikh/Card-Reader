# Card-Reader

In this project, I developed an android program to read Iranian credit card numbers and expiration dates using Tensorflow Lite.

3 CNN networks were trained for this task. First CNN network searched the image and reported the place of credit card number and expiration date. The second and third networks were trained to respectively read the credit card number and expiration date.

After training the network, a smooth android app was developed to open the device camera to take images and process these images in the background.
An android library was created for opening the camera and processing them using TensorFlow.

This repository contains an example program to use this library. For more information contact me!
